    Provides a mechanism for aggregating all signals

    Keeps track of updating the asset universe for each signal
    if a DynamicUniverse is utilised.

    Ensures each signal receives a new data point at the
    appropriate simulation iteration rate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : `dict{str: Signal}`
        Map of signal name to derived instance of Signal
    data_handler : `DataHandler`
        The data handler used to obtain pricing.

        Allow Signal to be returned via dictionary-like syntax.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signal : `str`
            The signal string.

        Returns
        -------
        `Signal`
            The signal instance.

        ----------
        dt : `pd.Timestamp`
            The time at which the signals are to be updated for.
